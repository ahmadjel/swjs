          "name": "Functional Lazy Loading of Images",
          "description": "Images are set to lazy load using the modern and efficient Intersection Observer API. This ensures that images outside the initial viewport do not impact the initial page load time, significantly improving First Contentful Paint (FCP) and Largest Contentful Paint (LCP). The implementation now correctly handles images in post cards and within the post body."

          "name": "Optimized CSS",
          "description": "All CSS is contained within a single `<b:skin>` tag, which Blogger automatically optimizes and serves. While inline critical CSS is a future goal, the current monolithic structure is standard for Blogger and has been written to be as efficient as possible. CSS variables are used for fast rendering and theme switching (dark mode)."

          "name": "Asynchronous/Deferred Scripts (by design)",

          "name": "Minimalist DOM",
          "description": "The HTML structure is clean, semantic, and avoids the deep nesting and unnecessary elements often found in other templates, leading to faster rendering by the browser."

          "name": "Logical Heading Structure",
          "description": "The template is designed to enforce a logical heading hierarchy (`h1` for the main title, `h2` for post titles on index pages, etc.), which is crucial for accessibility."
        },
        {
          "name": "High-Contrast Text (by default)",
