## Version 1.0.0 (2025-11-13)

**Initial Release**

This is the first official release of the jelmix Blogger template. This version was built from scratch with a focus on performance, SEO, and modern design principles.

### ✨ Features & Enhancements

*   **Initial Build:** Completely new theme engineered from the ground up, merging the best concepts from `Median-UI`, `plus-ui`, and `spotLite` templates.
*   **Modern Architecture:** Built with a valid Blogger XML structure, a clean HTML5 layout, and a mobile-first responsive design using CSS Flexbox and Grid.
*   **Performance Optimized:**
    *   No jQuery dependency. All interactive features are powered by lightweight, vanilla ES6+ JavaScript.
    *   Images are lazy-loaded using the efficient `IntersectionObserver` API to reduce initial page load times.
*   **Advanced SEO:**
    *   Comprehensive JSON-LD structured data schemas for `WebSite`, `Article`, and `BreadcrumbList`.
    *   Dynamic Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for rich social sharing.
    *   Proper canonical URL and robots meta directives for optimal search engine indexing.
*   **CSS & Styling:**
    *   Modern, responsive, and mobile-first CSS architecture.
    *   Extensive use of CSS variables for easy customization of colors, fonts, and spacing.
*   **Core Blogger Logic:**
    *   Clean, from-scratch implementation of the main post loop for the homepage and archive pages.
    *   Optimized single post view with placeholders for an author box, share buttons, and related posts.
*   **Documentation:**
    *   Initial `README.md` created with detailed installation and customization instructions.

### 🛠️ Fixes

*   Not applicable for the initial release, as all code is new.

### 🗑️ Removed

*   **jQuery Dependency:** Unlike the analyzed templates, jelmix is completely free of jQuery, resulting in a significantly smaller and faster codebase.
*   **Outdated Practices:** Removed all legacy inline scripting and complex, hard-to-maintain XML logic found in the analyzed templates.
